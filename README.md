[Arabella Young](https://medicine.utah.edu/pathology/news/2022/11/meet-dr-arabella-young) is involved in a real world cohort study termed RADIOHEAD, a pan-tumor, prospective cohort study of 1,200 individuals on standard of care first-line CPI treatment regimens aiming to identify drivers of irAEs and clinical response. An abstract of the study is published [here](https://jitc.bmj.com/content/10/Suppl_2/A1304). 

Her student [Samantha Stone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-stone-010ba2110/) or Sammy obtained an aspect of the clinical data documenting the variation of drugs that was administered to each patients. The drugs are non-harmonized, ie different spellings, some include drug dose, some do not. So the idea is to harmonized the drugs into specific categories. Sammy did some harmonization work, we can initially summarize her categories
## Objectives
